        Pirate Cove is a robust, cloud-hosted Personal Contact Manager designed to showcase full-stack web development and professional software engineering practices. Built on a remote DigitalOcean LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), the project features a responsive frontend that utilizes asynchronous AJAX and JSON to communicate seamlessly with a custom, Swagger-documented RESTful API. Our team prioritized a clean, user-centric experience by implementing secure user authentication, real-time server-side search, and intuitive inline CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to create a smooth, Single-Page Application feel. From initial UML and database planning to GitHub version control and final deployment under a custom domain, this project reflects our comprehensive approach to delivering a polished, production-ready web application.
